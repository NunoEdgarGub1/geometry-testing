1: (0, 2), (4, 1)
2: (2, 5), (3, 0), (-0.5, 4), (2.8, 5.5), (2.7, 5), (4, 6)
3: (10, 3), (0, 0), (-3, 3), (0, 3), (8, 0), (13, -1), (1, 4), (8, -2), (1, 2)

Your solution seems to be acceptable, but for some of the polygons, the guards sets are suboptimal:

For polygon 2 (with 12 vertices), less than 6 guards should suffice.
